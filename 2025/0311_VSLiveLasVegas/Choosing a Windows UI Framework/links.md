### Using UWP with .NET 9

Detailed instructions to get this working with the current preview release can be found in the [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet-9-native-aot/) above. At a high level, you need to:

1. Install the latest .NET 9 SDK (or get it with your VS2022 install in the next step).
1. Install Visual Studio 2022 17.12 or later with the **Windows application development** workload, making sure to include the **Universal Windows Platform tools** and **Windows 11 SDK (10.0.26100.0)** components.
1. Get the [Windows SDK Preview bundle](https://aka.ms/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet9-windows-sdk) and follow the README instructions to install it.
1. Install the [VSIX](https://aka.ms/preview-uwp-support-for-dotnet9-templates-vsix) with the preview UWP project templates.

That will get you ready to create your first UWP project with .NET 9.
