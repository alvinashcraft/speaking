# Hosted-Toolbox

A hosted Foundry agent that loads tools from a single Foundry Toolbox via the AF Foundry hosting bridge.

`AddFoundryToolboxes(credential, name)` registers a `FoundryToolboxService` that connects to the Foundry Toolboxes MCP proxy at startup, discovers the toolbox's bundled tools via `tools/list`, and makes them available to the agent on every request. The agent code does nothing per request; the toolbox is baked in on the server.

This is the minimal toolbox intro. For a richer walkthrough where a single toolbox bundles three MCP tools each authenticated differently, see [`Hosted-Toolbox-AuthPaths/`](../Hosted-Toolbox-AuthPaths/).

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- A Foundry project with a deployed model (e.g., `gpt-4o`) and a Toolbox configured
- Azure CLI logged in (`az login`)

## Configuration

Copy the template and fill in your values:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<your-account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project>
AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
TOOLBOX_NAME=my-toolset
```

Configuration notes:

- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (local-dev) or `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (auto-injected in hosted containers).
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` (default `gpt-4o`).
- `TOOLBOX_NAME` (default `my-toolset`). Use `TOOLBOX_NAME`, not `FOUNDRY_TOOLBOX_NAME`: all `FOUNDRY_*` env-var names are reserved by the Foundry platform and rejected at agent-create, so a `FOUNDRY_*`-named value would not survive deployment.

The `Foundry.Hosting` package builds the toolbox proxy URL from `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` as `{FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}/toolboxes/{TOOLBOX_NAME}/mcp?api-version=v1` per [`tools-integration-spec.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/AgentSchema/blob/main/specs/agents/hosted_agents/container-spec/docs/tools-integration-spec.md) §2–§3.

## Running directly (contributors)

```powershell
cd dotnet/samples/04-hosting/FoundryHostedAgents/responses/Hosted-Toolbox
dotnet run --tl:off
```

### Test it

Using the Azure Developer CLI:

```powershell
azd ai agent invoke --local "What tools do you have available, and what can they do?"
```

## Running with Docker

### 1. Publish for the container runtime

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Debug -f net10.0 -r linux-musl-x64 --self-contained false -o out
```

### 2. Build and run

```powershell
docker build -f Dockerfile.contributor -t hosted-toolbox .

$env:AZURE_BEARER_TOKEN = (az account get-access-token --resource https://ai.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv)

docker run --rm -p 8088:8088 `
  -e AGENT_NAME=hosted-toolbox-agent `
  -e AZURE_BEARER_TOKEN=$env:AZURE_BEARER_TOKEN `
  --env-file .env `
  hosted-toolbox
```

## Deploying to Foundry (azd spec)

This sample includes an `azd` manifest (`agent.manifest.yaml`) and hosted agent spec (`agent.yaml`) for deployment to Foundry.

Initialize an `azd` project from this sample's manifest:

```powershell
mkdir hosted-toolbox; cd hosted-toolbox
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/dotnet/samples/04-hosting/FoundryHostedAgents/responses/Hosted-Toolbox/agent.manifest.yaml
```

Then deploy:

```powershell
azd deploy
```

If you need to override defaults, set deployment-time environment variables in the `azd` environment before deploying:

```powershell
azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME gpt-4o
azd env set TOOLBOX_NAME my-toolset
```

For end-to-end hosted agent deployment guidance, see the [official deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

## NuGet package users

Use the standard `Dockerfile` instead of `Dockerfile.contributor`. See the commented section in `HostedToolbox.csproj` for the `PackageReference` alternative.

## Related samples

- [`Hosted-Toolbox-AuthPaths/`](../Hosted-Toolbox-AuthPaths/) — same hosting bones as this sample, but the toolbox bundles three MCP tools each authenticated differently (key, Entra agent identity, inline `Authorization`), driven by the shared `Using-Samples/SimpleAgent/` REPL.
- [`Hosted-McpTools/`](../Hosted-McpTools/) — contrasts client-side `McpClient` vs server-side `HostedMcpServerTool` for non-toolbox MCP servers.

## Troubleshooting

**`azd ai agent invoke` fails with `404 not_found: Conversation '<id>' not found`**

`azd` saves the session and conversation per agent and reuses them on the next invoke. Once the
agent is redeployed, deleted, or restarted, that saved conversation no longer exists on the server,
so every following invoke fails even though the agent itself is healthy. Start a fresh one:

```
azd ai agent invoke --new-conversation "Hello!"
```

Add `--new-session` as well if the failure persists.
